# Campus Course & Records Manager (CCRM)
A modern way to manage academic data and campus records smoothly

Educational institutions handle thousands of student and course records every year. But many campuses still rely on old, scattered, or manual systems that slow down work and cause frequent mistakes. CCRM aims to fix these everyday challenges by offering a clean, central, and modern solution.

# Problems CCRM Solves
1. Data is scattered and unreliable

Right now, student and course information often sits in multiple spreadsheets or unrelated software. Because everything isn’t connected, the same data may appear differently in different places. This creates confusion, complicated reporting, and unnecessary risks—especially when dealing with enrollments or grades.

2. Enrollment and grade handling is slow and error-prone

Without a unified system, managing semester courses, checking seat availability, enrolling students, and calculating GPAs become manual and time-consuming. One small mistake can lead to wrong grades, incorrect records, or compliance issues—all of which affect the student experience.

3. Old systems cannot keep up with today’s needs

Many campuses still use outdated systems that are hard to maintain or upgrade. They don’t follow modern coding principles, making it difficult to add new features or integrate with other tools. They also don’t use current Java capabilities like Streams or NIO.2, which help with faster processing, backups, and smooth file handling.
